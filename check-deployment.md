# GitHub Pages Deployment Check

## Steps to verify deployment:

1. **Check GitHub Actions**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click the "Actions" tab
   - Look for the latest "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow run
   - Make sure it completed successfully (green checkmark)

2. **Check GitHub Pages Settings**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Make sure source is set to "GitHub Actions"
   - Note the URL where your site should be available

3. **Access your site**:
   - Your site should be at: `https://dwasilewski3.github.io/Wasilewski-Holdings-Website/`
   - Wait a few minutes after the workflow completes
   - Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to clear cache

4. **If still seeing errors**:
   - Check the browser's Network tab in Developer Tools
   - Look for 404 errors on specific files
   - The built files should have names like `index-CuZvyCTY.js` not `main.jsx`

## Common Issues:

- **Caching**: GitHub Pages can take a few minutes to update
- **Wrong URL**: Make sure you're accessing the GitHub Pages URL, not the repository URL
- **Workflow not triggered**: Make sure you pushed to the `main` branch

## Expected Behavior:

After successful deployment, your site should load the compiled JavaScript files, not the source files.
